# BMIN-5200
This is a repository for my BMIN 5200 final project code, December 2024

Here I have written code for an expert system, using CLIPSPY. The expert system makes recommendations to clinicians about the type and rate of intravenous fluid to administer to patients, according to patient condition, heart failure status (where applicable), and supply of intravenous fluid available for use at a particular facility. With its simple user interface, this system can benefit clinicians with clear guidance about intravenous fluids and amounts that are appropriate for a set of clinical circumstances. At the same time this system can be valuable to health care organizations that are forced to conserve scarce intravenous fluid supplies during the current (December 2024) national intravenous fluid emergency.
